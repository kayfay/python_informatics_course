Out on the Mira on warm afternoons
Old men go fishing with black line and spoons
And if they catch nothing they never complain
And I wish I was with them again

As boys in the boats call to girls on the shore
Teasing the ones that they dearly adore
And into the evening the courting begins
And I wish I was with them again

Can you imagine a piece of the universe
More fit for princes and kings
I'll trade you ten of your cities for Marion Bridge
And the pleasure it brings

Out on the Mira on soft summer nights
Bonfires blaze to the children's delight
They dance 'round the flames singing songs with their friends
And I wish I was with them again

And over the ashes the stories are told
Of witches and werewolves and Oak Island gold
Stars on the river face sparkle and spin
I wish I was with them again

Can you imagine a piece of the universe
More fit for princes and kings
I'll trade you ten of your cities for Marion Bridge
And the pleasure it brings

Out on the Mira the people are kind
They'll treat you to homebrew and help you unwind
And if you come broken they'll see that you mend
I wish I was with them again

Now I'll conclude with a wish you go well
Sweet be your dreams and your happiness swell
I'll leave you here for my journey begins
I'm going to be with them again
