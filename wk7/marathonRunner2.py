# Purpose:    A marathon runner in training leave her house at 5:42 am.
# She runs the first two miles at a slow pace (8:25 per mile), then runs
# seven miles at her training pace (7:15 per mile).  She finishes with two
# miles at her slow pace.  What time is it when she gets home for
# breakfast?Â
